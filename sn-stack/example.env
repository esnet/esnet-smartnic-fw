#
# Note: The variables marked (Required) must be set in your .env file

# (Optional)
# Set this variable if you want to use a proxy (like harbor) when pulling images from docker hub.
#
# Note: Your proxy may require that you "docker login" before using it
#DOCKERHUB_PROXY=wharf.es.net/dockerhub-proxy/

# (Optional)
# Set this variable if you want to pull the xilinx-labtools-docker images from a registry rather than building locally
#LABTOOLS_REGISTRY=wharf.es.net/ht/

# (Optional)
# Set this variable to select a specific container version for xilinx-labtools
#LABTOOLS_TAG=23035-gbcaf220b

# (Optional)
# Choose a specific JTAG cable (and thus a specific U280 card) to take control of
# If this is commented out, it will default to "*" which just chooses the first JTAG cable it finds
# which is exactly what you want if you only have a single JTAG cable in your system.

# Note: An extra letter "A" must be appended to the serial number to get it to match in vivado labtools
